            <h2>All Pursue One Pleasure: The Pleasure of God</h2>
            <pre>
                Aristotle even suggests that this divine pleasure might be what all living
                beings are unconsciously pursuing. Like the hedonists Eudoxus and Epicurus,
                Aristotle suggests that the fact that all sentient beings, both humans and
                animals, pursue pleasure is evidence that pleasure is in some sense the highest
                good. Aristotle thinks as a biologist: what creatures aim at is their good,
                that which ensures their survival.43 At the same time, each being has its own
                good and hence its own form of pleasure; while they all pursue pleasure, they
                do not pursue precisely the same form of pleasure. But then he adds a caveat:
                perhaps they do in fact pursue the same pleasure, rather than the one they
                think they pursue, since everything by nature has something divine in it.44
                One interpretation of this passage is that all are unconsciously pursuing
                the ultimate pleasure, which is the unimpeded activity of contemplation, the
                activity of the Unmoved Mover. This is similar to Aristotle’s argument that
                all living beings love life, activity, and perception; it simply feels good to
                be aware, awake, and alive. Moreover, it is not simply the capacities for perception
                and thought but their active exercise that most fully constitutes living,
                and their active exercise is signaled or capped by pleasure.

                We see here Aristotle’s natural teleology, his sensibility as a biologist. If
                all beings in nature desire pleasure, pleasure must have a function to ensure
                the species’ good.45 There is an urge in every creature to realize its natural
                purpose. He thus suggests that this desire is a divine urge in each being for
                its good, that which will further its life. There is a universal desire for good,
                even though each species seeks its own unique good. A s Sarah Broadie suggests,
                this universal good may be the sheer pleasure of being alive, as Aristotle
                suggests in 9.9, or the urge for approximation to the divine, as he suggests in
                On the Soul (De Anima). In De Anima 2.4 Aristotle writes that plants and nonrational
                animals participate in the divine through biological continuation of
                their types. Thus even the desire for reproduction is a desire to imitate the
                divine, to perpetuate the beautiful, divine order of eternal species.

                God always enjoys the highest pleasure: the continuous activity of thinking,
                which is eudaimonia. We, however, also have a bodily nature, which seeks               
                to exercise other faculties and enjoy other pleasures. Aristotle seems to suggest
                that this desire for variety is a defect, rather than a virtue, for God enjoys
                a single, simple pleasure continually; it is a pleasure of rest rather than
                of motion.47 Nevertheless it is a pleasure of activity (energeia), not simply of
                static being. While actualization is not movement, it is the activation of
                potential; this actualization may be regarded as “rest” in the sense of being
                continuous, ongoing, and in that sense unchanging. Aristotle’s pleasure in
                rest has a vector, a teleological drive for the activation of excellence.
