            <h2>Confucian Pleasure and Joy</h2>
            <pre>
                Ritual practice and social interaction with full intentionality should ideally
                include practicing the Way with love and joy. This culminates in the kind of
                effortless ease of action that is harmony with the Way: “6.20 One who knows
                it is not the equal of one who loves it and one who loves it is not the equal of
                one who takes joy in it.” Similarly, when Confucius expresses his deepest desire,
                he suggests that the goal of Confucian practice is being at ease in virtue:
                “To bring ease to the aged, to have trust in my friends, and to cherish the
                youth (5.26).” And more poignantly in 11.26: “To assemble a company of five
                or six young men and six or seven boys to go bathe in the Yi river and enjoy
                the breeze upon the Rain Altar, and then return singing to the Master’s
                house. . . . I am with Zengxi!”

                Confucius thus aspires to a kind of effortless joy, a thorough immersion
                in ritual practice in which ritual becomes a dance in which one can gracefully
                lose oneself. Dance indeed is a fitting metaphor for the kind of wu-wei
                Confucius exemplifies, as the early ru were engaged in ritual dance and song.96
                There are moments in dance in which one is fully aware of one’s every motion,
                and others in which one becomes completely lost in the dance. These
                are two sides of the beauty of Confucian practice: attentive awareness and
                spontaneous, effortless ease.

                In our discussion of Aristotle and Epicurus, we asked two related questions:
                what is it to take pleasure or joy, and what are things in which people take
                pleasure? We conclude our study of Confucius by returning to the opening
                analect, which describes three things in which the sage takes joy: learning
                for the sake of self-cultivation, having friends visit from afar, and not minding
                if one is not recognized. That is, one finds joy in appreciating the intrinsic
                values of Confucian self-cultivation.97 When we are attuned to what we
                genuinely value in life, we find little importance in honor, material luxuries,
                fame, and approval and can take pleasure in the simple joys of friendship,
                family, and community.

                There is indeed a Stoic strand to Confucius’ thought; the greatest source
                of joy is our own virtue.98 The key to flourishing is taking pleasure in the
                kind of people we can become and the simple pleasure of living in harmony
                with others and the Way of the universe. To hear the Way is a source of delight:
                “In the morning, hear the Way; in the evening, die content” (4.8). We
                realize how good it is that there is a moral order to the universe and a way
                to align ourselves with it; the Way embodies normative ritual patterns
                whose rhythms bring joy and harmony. We are in right relationship with
                the world.

                We have noted Confucius’ conviction that “to understand [the Dao] is not
                as good as to delight in it; to delight in [the Dao] is not as good as to find joy
                in it” (6.20). In Chapter 7 we will see a similar progression in the thought of
                the Jewish philosopher Maimonides—a connection between understanding,
                love, and joy. Of course there are significant differences between the two
                thinkers as well. Maimonides, like Aristotle, takes joy in cognitive understanding,
                while Confucius’ brand of wisdom is not purely discursive or theoretical;
                it is understanding of the way things are and the best way to live. The
                final stage is when we embrace the Confucian Way wholeheartedly as a way
                we ourselves can follow. Ivanhoe points to the significance of the pairing of
                music and joy brought out pungently by Mencius. Like moral self-cultivation,
                music can take us over and bring us joy even despite ourselves; as Mencius
                expresses it, our feet start tapping and our hands start dancing.100 We realize
                we are growing—and there is no experience like it. To learn and to grow
                are experiences that bring deep and lasting fulfillment.101
                Key to Confucius’ conception of joy, as Ivanhoe brings out elegantly, is
                a sense of giving ourselves over to something greater—social solidarity
                and connection to others, to the past through tradition and to the present
                through family and community.102 Confucius is aware of the power of selftranscendence;
                the sense of being connected to a larger whole can be a
                powerful motivating force, whether for goodness and health or for the
                unwholesome. 
                    Thus Confucius notes:
                        16.5 People take joy in three things that help them and three things that injure
                        them. To find joy in the regulation provided by ritual and music, to find joy in
                        discussing the goodness of others, and to find joy in having many worthy friends—
                        these things help. To take joy in extravagance, to find joy in desultory wandering,
                        and to take joy in feasting—these things injure.

                We therefore see in Confucius as we did in Aristotle that pleasure and joy are
                normative concepts. To take pleasure in what injures is not proper, and thus
                it is not accurate to call this pleasure. Pleasure is what the good person enjoys:
                the harmony provided by ritual and music, appreciating the goodness
                of others, delighting in friendships that help us grow. Ritual and music enhance
                our sense of self-mastery; they bring us disciplined spontaneity, freedom,
                and joy. We know that anarchy is not freedom; we can be at loose ends
                not knowing what to do with ourselves. We find a deeper sense of freedom
                within a structure—giving ourselves the pleasures our mind, body, and emotions
                can genuinely enjoy in balanced measures. Plato, Aristotle, and Confucius
                thus stress the importance of moral education; we must educate our
                senses to take pleasure in those things that will bring us genuine fulfillment.
                Happiness for Confucius lies in cultivating our full humanity and expressing
                humaneness in our interactions and relationships. We can thus enjoy
                the harmony that arises from practice of ancient cultural forms and attunement
                to a moral order that is good and beautiful.
