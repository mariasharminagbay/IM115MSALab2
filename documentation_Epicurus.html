            <h2>Theory of Perception, Atomism, and Pleasure</h2>
            <pre>
                Epicurus is an atomist. Without exploring the details of his atomic theory,
                let us examine the way his atomism rounds out his theory of pleasure.18 The
                foundation of Epicurean epistemology is known as the “canonic,” a series of
                criteria by which sound judgments are made. There are two main criteria of
                judgment: sense perception (aisthēsis) and feeling (pathos).19 Sense perception
                gathers information from the world through the medium of sense
                organs, which discriminate sense objects. As Elizabeth Asmis explains,
                “Aisthēsis is directed at objects other than one’s condition, whereas a feeling
                (pathos) is an awareness of one’s own condition.”
                We experience our own condition as pleasant and familiar or unpleasant
                and alien. This is because the pathē refer to atomic conditions. When we are
                met by information from the external world, the atoms of our sense organs
                are either preserved in their natural flow or find their natural flow disrupted.
                We experience the preservation of the natural flow or order of our atoms as
                familiar, appropriate, and “right”; its disruption we experience as alien, inappropriate,
                and unpleasant. Pleasure is what preserves our sense of natural
                flow; pain is what disrupts it.

                Pleasure is thus what philosophers of mind call an “intentional state”; it
                contains an awareness and primitive response to the object of awareness, even
                at the level of the atoms of our sense organs. Pleasure thus entails what philosophers
                of mind call an “attitude”—a psychological stance or orientation—
                toward an object. Every pathos has a feeling tone of either pleasure or pain,
                attraction or aversion. A pathos contains an awareness of an object and, at the
                same time, a “liking” or “disliking” of that object.22 In Asmis’ words, unlike
                sense perceptions, feelings represent “an attitude, pro or contra, concerning
                the object of awareness. To attend to something pleasant is to be attracted to it;
                to attend to something painful is to have an aversion from it.”

                How does this atomic theory shed light on Epicurus’ understanding of
                pleasure? The Cyrenaics recognized only one form of pleasure, kinetic pleasure.
                They view the katastematic condition as one of a corpse; if there is no
                satisfaction of desire, there is no pleasure. Epicurus, in contrast, recognizes
                two forms of pleasure: katastematic and kinetic. Katastematic pleasure is
                the pleasure of a settled condition, kinetic pleasure that of a moving condition.
                However, we can now see that this terminology is somewhat confusing,
                because in fact both conditions contain movement. In the katastematic
                condition, the atoms move in natural, smooth patterns, whereas in pain
                these patterns are disrupted. In kinetic pleasure, the atoms move in patterns
                of pleasurable excitement. We might therefore translate kinēsis here
                as “stimulation”: both types of pleasure preserve patterns of the motion of
                atoms, but the kinetic patterns are more excited ones, produced by external
                stimulation.24 Kinetic pleasure is thus that which occurs when the organism
                in its natural, katastematic state of pleasure is stimulated in a way that preserves
                its natural flow.

                Thus the capacity to experience katastematic pleasure consists in attuning
                oneself, through an act of focused attention (epibolē), to a pleasurable state
                of one’s own being.26 It is constitutional pleasure. Whether we are sitting quietly
                in meditation or moving dynamically in sacred dance, the rhythm of
                our being is preserved. A Beethoven symphony goes through many moods—
                some quiet and contemplative, others furious and triumphant; they all share
                a quality of harmonious pattern. Human beings too, go through many moods,
                but can discover a harmonious pattern in the motion of their atoms through
                moments of both quiet rest and active engagement.

                This is why Epicurus can term both katastematic and kinetic pleasure
                pleasure. What they share in common is the preservation of a certain 
                psycho-physical harmony, which a living being finds familiar, appropriate,
                and non-disruptive. Kinetic events such as Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring contain
                much dissonance, excitement, and agitation, but may provide stimulation
                that harmonizes with one’s natural flow. The sound of a jackhammer, in contrast,
                is disruptive and creates agitation that most find alien to our natural
                pattern. Thus the rhythm of sacred dancing, art, and music are variations on
                the harmonic atomic motions of sitting quietly. Epicurus suggests that if we
                become familiar with the basic rhythm of our being in its quiet state, we can
                preserve this harmony when going out into moving forms and return in contentment
                to quiet—not preferring one over the other.

                Epicurus taught that discovering this art is the key to happiness. Epicurean
                wisdom involves recognition that since moving pleasures cannot continue
                unabated, excitement alone does not bring genuine and lasting happiness.
                Katastematic pleasure, as the harmony of the natural being, is by definition
                lasting and stable. When we have tempered and disciplined desires, we
                can learn to appreciate this as the highest joy. Then, without fear of attachment
                to excitement and without fear of loss, we are free to enjoy the kinetic
                pleasures that come and go.
